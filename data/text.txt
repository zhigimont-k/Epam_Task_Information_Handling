    It has survived - not only (five) centuries, but also the leap into 13<<2 electronic typesetting, remaining 3>>5 essentially ~6&9|(3&4) unchanged. It was popularised in the ~(121>>4)|(78&77)&90 with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
    It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using ~71&2&3|78 Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using (Content here), content here', making it look like readable English.
    It is a 2>>3&(~1)<<5 established fact that a reader will be of a page when looking at its layout.
